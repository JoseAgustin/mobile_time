@techreport{mobile-AP42,
	Abstract = {All of the emission factor tables for each vehicle type are given within this appendix. Each emission factor table has two digit identification table number. If the contents of the table is altitude dependet, then this stable has a additional third igit in its number. The tables numbers haave the following format:
VT.\#.R

where VT indicates the vehicle type
1= LDGV, 2=LDGT1, 3= LDGT2, 4 = HDGV,
5 = LDDV, 6= LDDT, 7 = HDDV and 8 = MC

\# indicates which of the types f tables are referenced

R indicates the region code
	1 - low altitude non-California region and
	2 - High altitude non-Californoa region
In addition to this coding scheme or the tables numbers, the table titles include the information to avoid confusion. Talbe H-1 gives a summary of every table number},

@techreport{TESM-1993,
	Abstract = {The structure and functionality of the T{\"U}V Emissions Simulation Model' (TESM) will be briefly described.This description is bsed upond the `Technical Report' of January 1991 or the project `Air Pollution Control in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area'. More recent developments are included. The structure and internal flow of data will be illustrated as well as interfaces for coupling TESM to other systems,.e.e. dispersion models. Hints on hard- and software background will be given. With the im of improved quality assurance, an important guidelines has been the use of quality proved standard software as fas as possible.
TEMS is a system to analyze and forecast emissions and other characteristic data from mobile and stationarry source (traffic, industry, small stablihment and households, gasoline servide stations, natural sources,.). Having the freedom to vary all esssential parameters influencing the process of calculation of emissions, energy consumption, .. TESM is to be seen as a ``dynamical Emission Inventory'', capable of doing when-if analyzes within the scope of given constraints (e.g. a certain amount of traffic demand). Placing emissions scenarios developed in this way for disposal to uthorities TESM may serve as decision-making tool.
TESM may bee xpanded to a more general ``environmental information system'' for example within a s'scientificbase' program. This coulbe archvied by inclusion of add-on dules for inventory managment of impacto of noiuse or ground pollutions by sptial distributed toxic waste.},
